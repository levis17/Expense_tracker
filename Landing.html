        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          The inspiration for Expense Tracker came from personal struggles in managing finances effectively
          and I found it challenging to keep track of my expenses, set budgets, and gain insights into our spending
          habits.
          As an individual with diverse skills in software development and a passion for financial responsibility, I
          decided to embark on a journey to create a solution that would simplify personal finance management for
          everyone.

          Throughout the timeline of this project, I experienced moments of excitement, frustration, and triumph.
          It has been a tremendous learning experience for each of me, pushing my boundaries and encouraging me to
          think innovatively.
